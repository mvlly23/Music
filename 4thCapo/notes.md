# 4th Capo

# Guitar:
Follow typical christian/gospel chord structure in verse
adjust to more metal structure through bridge/chorus

## Typical gospel chord structures:

| F     | F A C Eb | Common |
| Bb    | Bb D F Ab |      |
| F     | F A C Eb |       |
| D     | D F (or F#) A C | Uncommon |
| C     | C E G Bb |        |
| G     | G B E F | uncommon V of V |
| C     | C E G Bb | Turnaround |


| Index | Guitar | 4th Capo |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 0     | F A C Eb | A C# E G |
| 1     | Bb D F Ab | D F# A C |
| 2     | F A C Eb | A C# E G |
| 3     | D F (or F#) A C | F# A/Bb C# E | 
| 4     | C E G Bb | E Ab B D |
| 5     | G B E F | B Eb C# A |
| 6     | C E G Bb | E Ab B D |

| Index | Thoughts | Score (-2 to +2) |
|-------|----------|-------|
| 0 | Meh-ville | 0 |
| 1 | Bb->D bad | -1 |
| 2 | Cheesy (but good for this) | +2 |
| 3 | Difficult, but nice | +1 |
| 4 | G->Bb bad | 0 |
| 5 | B stinky | -1 |
| 6 | Bb doesn't resolve well | -1 |

Based on that I really dont like Bb lmao

But the best candidates is `F A C Eb`

## Analysis

Having trouble determining the exact scale, but thinking
about putting this in the F Locrian Scale with a sharp 
A and C. This would allow it to easily move into the dark 
tones for the bridge/chorus that Locrian is known for.

Its currently moving up every other note which is pretty lame (to me at least lol)

For bridge maybe move into a 5-3-1 pattern (Keep from a good proper resolve) into chorus as a 5-3-5
